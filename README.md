Design Change:
From the feedback I have got having a website dedicated on steaks would be a very narrow in brief, therefore I decided to change it to Cooking Techniques Tracker, the purpose of the web app is to track users cooking methods and would rate users with achievments, the website would also provide tutorial videos for users to allow them to get better on using specific methods to achive the master badge for each type of cooking. The website also contains a communities features so people can share their achievements they have and experiences with different techniches
